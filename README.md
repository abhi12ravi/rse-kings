# RSE-King's 
This is a task for the RSE role at King's College, London.

## Goals of this project
1. To develop a HTTP server in Python as described in the task description

### Task description:
"Please develop an HTTP server in a language of your choice. 

The server should have two endpoints, a GET route, available at '/helloworld', that responds with 'helloworld', and a POST route, available at '/echo', that accepts a body of data, and returns that same body of data as a part of the response. 

Please also supply a 'driver' program, which demonstrates the functionality of the server by calling each route. 

Detailed comments should be added to explain the functionality of the code produced. 

Please commit your code to an online repository of your choosing, and send a link to martin.chapman@kcl.ac.uk by 6pm Friday 24th September."
